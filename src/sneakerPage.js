However, this silhouette was not very popular, Michael wrote history that season, when he made the winning shot, wearing the Jordan 4 Fire Red. After that, the love for the Jordan 4 Fire Red started. <br><br> After 30 years, the Jordan 4 Fire Red released last year in the exact same way as the original Jordan 4 Fire Red pair from 1989.

However, luckily for Jordan fans, it’s aiming for a potential come-back around the bend for its fourth retro release since its debut in 1989. According to @soleheatonfeet, a White/Tech Grey/Black/Fire Red colorway will be targeting a return sometime in May of next year and there’s a chance that the shoe in question could be the aforementioned OG, so stay tuned as we receive more information regarding a concrete release date on Nike.com and through select retailers.",

For starters, the side Swooshes are reversed, which each tailing facing the toe. Woven tongue tags are shifted and stitched to the side of the tongue instead of the top. Also, in the collar, there is a hidden stash pocket. A one-of-a-kind design fit for a one-of-a-kind artist. The Air Jordan 1 Travis Scott features a white leather upper with Mocha suede overlays and black leather reversed Swooshes. Hits of red on the tongue slightly contrast the design's earth tones. On the heel, a debossed Cactus Jack logo adds a custom feel. From there, a yellowed midsole and matching Mocha outsole complete the design. <br><br>The Jordan 1 Travis Scott Mocha released in May 2019 and retailed for $175.",
